(defn deutsch-algorithm
  "Implement the Deutsch algorithm to determine if a function is constant or balanced.
  
  The Deutsch algorithm solves the problem: Given a function f: {0,1} → {0,1},
  determine whether f is constant (f(0) = f(1)) or balanced (f(0) ≠ f(1))
  using only one quantum query, compared to 2 classical queries needed.
  
  Algorithm steps:
  1. Initialize |0⟩|1⟩ state (input qubit |0⟩, ancilla qubit |1⟩)
  2. Apply Hadamard to both qubits: |+⟩|-⟩
  3. Apply oracle function Uf
  4. Apply Hadamard to input qubit
  5. Measure input qubit: 0 = constant, 1 = balanced
  
  Parameters:
  - oracle-fn: Function that takes a boolean input and returns boolean output
               Represents the quantum oracle Uf
  
  Returns:
  Map containing:
  - :result - :constant or :balanced
  - :measurement-outcome - 0 for constant, 1 for balanced

(defn shor-algorithm
  "Shor's algorithm for integer factorization.
  
  Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can factor large integers
  exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithms. It combines
  classical preprocessing, quantum period finding, and classical post-processing.
  
  Algorithm steps:
  1. Classical preprocessing: Check for trivial cases
  2. Choose random a < N, check gcd(a,N)  
  3. Quantum period finding: Find period r of f(x) = a^x mod N
  4. Classical post-processing: Extract factors from the period
  
  Parameters:
  - N: Integer to factor (should be composite)
  - n-qubits: Number of qubits for quantum period finding (default: 2*⌈log₂(N)⌉)
  
  Returns:
  Map containing:
  - :factors - Vector of non-trivial factors found (empty if factorization failed)
  - :success - Boolean indicating if factorization succeeded
  - :N - The input number
  - :attempts - Vector of maps describing each attempt with different 'a' values
  - :quantum-circuit - The quantum circuit from the successful attempt (if any)
  
  Example:
