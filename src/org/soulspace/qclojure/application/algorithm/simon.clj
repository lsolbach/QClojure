  "Simon's Algorithm
   
   Simon's algorithm solves the hidden subgroup problem for the group (Z₂)ⁿ.
   Given a function f: {0,1}ⁿ → {0,1}ⁿ that is either one-to-one or two-to-one,
   and if two-to-one then f(x) = f(x ⊕ s) for some hidden string s ≠ 0ⁿ,
   the algorithm finds s with exponential speedup over classical methods.

   This implementation builds the quantum circuit for Simon's algorithm
   and executes it on a specified quantum backend.
   
   The algorithm uses a quantum oracle Uf that computes f(x) = f(x ⊕ s),
   where s is the hidden period and x is the input bit string.
   
   The algorithm requires only O(n) quantum operations to find the hidden period,
   while classical algorithms would require O(2^(n/2)) queries to find s."

  "Implement Simon's algorithm to find the hidden period of a function.
  
  Simon's algorithm solves the hidden subgroup problem for the group (Z₂)ⁿ.

  4. Measure output register (collapses to some value)
  5. Apply Hadamard to input register
