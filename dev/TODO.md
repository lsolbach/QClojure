# TODOs

## Next steps
* rename *-oracle-circuit fns to add-oracle
* check shor's algorithm implementation
* refactor algorithms to use a provided backend
  * grover
  * quantum fourier transformation
  * quantum period finding
  * shor
* check validation/optimization for backend topology (e.g. [[0 1] [1 2] [2 3]])

## Backlog
