# TODOs

## Next steps
* check shor's algorithm implementation
* refactor algorithms to use a provided backend
  * grover
  * quantum fourier transformation
  * quantum period finding
  * shor

## Backlog
* reduce code duplication
* check for inconsistant usage of operations/gates
* add validation/optimization for backend topology (e.g. [[0 1] [1 2] [2 3]])
* fix vertical alignment of gates in ascii circuit visualization
* add separation between text and graphics in svg visualization
* extract formatting information to edn
