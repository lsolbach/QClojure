# TODOs

## Next steps
* fix inconsistant usage of operations/gates

## Backlog
* move circuit composition and extension to circuit-transformation
* move math functions (e.g. continued-fractions) to math ns
* make algorithms use a provided backend
* reduce code duplication
* add validation/optimization for backend topology (e.g. [[0 1] [1 2] [2 3]])
* fix vertical alignment of gates in ascii circuit visualization
* add separation between text and graphics in svg visualization
* extract formatting information to edn
* check shor's algorithm implementation
