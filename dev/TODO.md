# TODOs

## Next steps
* check shor's algorithm implementation
* refactor algorithms to use a provided backend
  * grover
  * quantum fourier transformation
  * shor

## Backlog
* track qubit mapping on circuit tansformations
  * use qubit mapping on measure operations
* reduce code duplication
* check for inconsistant usage of operations/gates
* check order of the optimizations (what if backend doesn't support SWAP)
* fix vertical alignment of gates in ascii circuit visualization
* add separation between text and graphics in svg visualization
* extract formatting information to edn
