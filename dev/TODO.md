# TODOs

## Next steps
* rename gate-registry to operation-registry
* rename gate-catalog to operation-catalog
* rename attributes from :gate* to :operation*
* add :operation-kind from #{:gate :measurement}
* change usage of :gate* attributes

## Backlog
* move circuit composition and extension to circuit-transformation
* move circuit transformation to domain
* move math functions (e.g. continued-fractions) to math ns
* reduce code duplication
* make algorithms use a provided backend
* fix vertical alignment of gates in ascii circuit visualization
* add separation between text and graphics in svg visualization
* extract formatting information to edn
* check shor's algorithm implementation
