;; # Quantum Computing
;; Quantum computing is a revolutionary field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers. QClojure provides a Clojure-based framework for building and simulating quantum circuits.
;;
;; ## Key Concepts
;; - **Qubits**: The basic unit of quantum information, analogous to bits in classical computing.
;; - **Quantum Gates**: Operations that manipulate qubits, similar to logic gates in classical circuits.
;; - **Quantum Circuits**: A sequence of quantum gates applied to qubits to perform computations.
;; - **Quantum Algorithms**: Algorithms designed to run on quantum computers, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring integers and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases.
;; - **Quantum Measurement**: The process of extracting classical information from quantum states, collapsing superpositions into definite outcomes.
;; - **Quantum Simulation**: Using quantum computers to simulate quantum systems, which can be exponentially faster than classical simulations.
;; - **Quantum Backends**: The underlying hardware or simulator that executes quantum circuits, providing the interface for quantum operations.
;; - **Quantum Entanglement**: A phenomenon where qubits become correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter the distance between them.
;; - **Quantum Superposition**: The ability of qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallelism in quantum computations.
;; - **Quantum Decoherence**: The loss of quantum coherence due to interaction with the environment, which can lead to errors in quantum computations.
;; - **Quantum Error Correction**: Techniques to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other noise.
