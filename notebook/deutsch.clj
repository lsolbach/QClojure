;; # The Deutsch Algorithm
;; The Deutsch algorithm is a quantum algorithm that solves the problem of determining whether a given function is constant or balanced using only one evaluation of the function. It is one of the simplest quantum algorithms and serves as an introduction to quantum computing concepts.
;;
;; ## Problem Statement
;; Given a function \( f: \{0, 1\} \to \{0, 1\} \), the goal is to determine if \( f \) is constant (returns the same value for both inputs) or balanced (returns 0 for one input and 1 for the other).
;;
;; ## Classical Approach
;; In a classical setting, we would need to evaluate the function \( f \) twice:
;; - If \( f(0) = f(1) \), then \( f \) is constant.
;; - If \( f(0) \neq f(1) \), then \( f \) is balanced.
;;
;; ## Quantum Approach
;; The Deutsch algorithm allows us to determine the nature of the function with only one evaluation by leveraging quantum superposition and interference.
;;
;; ## Quantum Circuit
;; The Deutsch algorithm can be implemented using a quantum circuit with the following steps:
;; 1. Initialize a qubit in the state \( |0\rangle \) and an auxiliary qubit in the state \( |1\rangle \).
;; 2. Apply a Hadamard gate to both qubits to create superposition.
;; 3. Apply the function \( f \) as a quantum gate, which will entangle the qubits.
;; 4. Apply another Hadamard gate to the first qubit.
;; 5. Measure the first qubit.
