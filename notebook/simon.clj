;; # The Simon Algorithm
;; The Simon algorithm is a quantum algorithm that solves the problem of finding a hidden period in a function. It is an example of how quantum computing can outperform classical computing for certain problems.
;;
;; ## Problem Statement
;; Given a function \( f: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^n \) that is promised to be periodic with a hidden period \( s \), the goal is to find \( s \) using fewer evaluations of \( f \) than would be possible classically.
;;
;; ## Classical Approach
;; In a classical setting, we would need to evaluate the function \( f \) multiple times to find the period \( s \). The number of evaluations required can grow exponentially with the size of the input.
;;
;; ## Quantum Approach
;; The Simon algorithm allows us to find the hidden period \( s \) with a polynomial number of evaluations by leveraging quantum superposition and interference.
;;
;; ## Quantum Circuit
;; The Simon algorithm can be implemented using a quantum circuit with the following steps:
;; 1. Initialize \( n \) qubits in the state \( |0\rangle \) and \( n \) auxiliary qubits in the state \( |1\rangle \).
;; 2. Apply a Hadamard gate to all \( n \) qubits to create superposition.
;; 3. Apply the function \( f \) as a quantum gate, which will entangle the qubits.
;; 4. Measure the auxiliary qubits to obtain a set of equations that can be solved classically to find the hidden period \( s \).
